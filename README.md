Horoscope Bot
====================================

**Tweeting live at: [https://twitter.com/HoroscopeBot](https://twitter.com/HoroscopeBot)**

A simple twitter bot which assembles statements of the form "you will" into unreliable horoscopes. A weekend project inspired by [Darius Kazemi](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions/darius-kazemi-s-bots/members) and [Rob Dubbin](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/29-olivia-taters-robot-teenager/). Designed to be hosted on [Google Script](https://script.google.com/), following a tutorial template by [Amit Agarwal](http://www.labnol.org/internet/write-twitter-bot/27902/).

Also using Darius's bad word filter: [https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/)

My favourite assembled tweet so far:

>Libra â™Ž: You will be my queen, but you will NEVER MAKE A FREE THROW IN YOUR LIFE .
